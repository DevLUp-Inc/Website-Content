### Berni and Murcer Club-Wide Game Jam

In this project, a group upwards of 30 DevLUp members of all experience levels worked together in conjuction with Berni and Murcer in order to bring to life their idea for a kids game based on their childrens book. This event lasted a total of 72 hours and the team completed the majority of the initial ice level and game systems.
