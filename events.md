# DevLUp Events

We are facilitating events for collaboration between Game Developers. These often include Game Jams as well as collaborative projects to allow participants to grow their skills as well as gain experience with applying them in relevant situations. 

Here you will find a list of our current, upcoming, and past events. For more information on getting involved or viewing projects produced during these events head over to [our Discord](https://devlup.org/r/discord)

## Current

### 100 Days of Gamedev

> May 1st to Aug 14th, 2022

Showoff your game development progress in our Discord!

Working towards improving your skills or a personal project in game development? Let the community know how it's going and get direct feedback, as well as start discussion on topics you're interested in. Our #showoff channel is one of the most active in our Discord and there is never a lack of interaction.

Our very own DevLUp Discord bot will also keep track of your projects for you and log your interaction with the event. See how you stack up against the rest of the server and receive roles reflecting your hard work!

## Upcoming

Currently, during the Summer our community is focused on working on individual projects and developing their skills which you can view in our #showoff channel in our Discord. Come Fall we will begin hosting our larger events for our community, so stay tuned!

### Berni and Murcer Club Wide Game Jam

In this project a group upwards of 30 DevLUp Members of all experience levels worked together in cojuction with Berni and Murcer's team in order to bring to life their idea for a kids game based on their childrens book. This event lasted a total of 72 hours and the team completed the majority of the initial ice level and the game systems.
