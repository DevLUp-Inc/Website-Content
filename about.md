# We are DevLUp!

Previously known as the UF Game Developer's Association (UF GDA), DevLUp was created by University of Florida students interested in game development. Since around December 2020, we've grown from **100** to **700 members.

### Why are so many people joining?
* We help teach beginners game dev through **weekly workshops**.
* We've got a community full of talent that **communicates 3x as much as the average larger student org** discord at UF! (Not another dead discord!)
* We're constantly improving, and we keep our members involved in that process.

## Our Purpose

### Community

* The backbone of DevLUp is the supportive and interactive online community we foster. You can find mentors, feedback, opportunities, and friends that share the common interest in game development. We host fun social events too, including but not limited to...
  * semesterly potlucks
  * semesterly game nights featuring
    * rocket league
    * private MC Hunger games
    * Splitgate
    * and more... 

### Development

* At DevLUp providing our members with oppurtunities to grow both professionally and in their personal approaches is always a top priority. Past events such as the Berni and Murcer Game Jam have given members experience working for clients and in a large development team. More oppurtunities like these will be present in the near future so keep an eye out in our discord.

### Education

* As earlier stated DevLUp aims to provide resources and tools necessary for users interested in growing their game development skills. We are currently working on finalizing the curriculum which will soon be available on our website free of charge. The curriculum will be accomponied by our discord bot and community, and other tools that will enchance the game development journey for all users.

### Enjoyment

* While we aim to create an effective environment to grow skills and acquire knowledge. We also want our members to make sure they are taking time to enjoy the journey. Often in areas like game development there can be a large focus on the end results. By providing fun and engaging activities hosted in our discord as well as in person we aim to bring the focus back to the enjoyment of the game development journey, which ultimately is the biggest metric for determining success in indidivuduals.
