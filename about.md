# We are DevLUp!

DevLUp was created by University of Florida students interested in game development. What originally began as a small group for students to discuss a common interest has grown into a community that fosters growth for it's members skills.

DevLUp does not stop there. In conjuction to our online community we will be offering resources to help individuals throughout their game development journeys. We hope that by lowering the barrier to entry to game development by providing educational tools and resources to our users we can grow the game developer community as a whole.

## Our Purpose

### Community

* The backbone of DevLUp and what we are most proud of is the supportive and interactive online community present in our discord. Here you can find mentors, feedback, opportunities, and friends that share the common interest in game development.

### Development

* At DevLUp providing our members with oppurtunities to grow both professionally and in their personal approaches is always a top priority. Past events such as the Berni and Murcer Game Jam have given members experience working for clients and in a large development team. More oppurtunities like these will be present in the near future so keep an eye out in our discord.

### Education

* As earlier stated DevLUp aims to provide resources and tools necessary for users interested in growing their game development skills. We are currently working on finalizing the curriculum which will soon be available on our website free of charge. The curriculum will be accomponied by our discord bot and community, and other tools that will enchance the game development journey for all users.

### Enjoyment

* While we aim to create an effective environment to grow skills and acquire knowledge. We also want our members to make sure they are taking time to enjoy the journey. Often in areas like game development there can be a large focus on the end results. By providing fun and engaging activities hosted in our discord as well as in person we aim to bring the focus back to the enjoyment of the game development journey, which ultimately is the biggest metric for determining success in indidivuduals.
