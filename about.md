# We are DevLUp!
Previously known as the UF Game Developer's Association (UF GDA), DevLUp was created by University of Florida students interested in game development. Since around December 2020, we've grown from **100** to **700 members.**

### Why are so many people joining?
  * We help teach beginners and pros through **weekly workshops**.
  * We've got a community full of talent that **communicates 3x as much as the average larger student org** discord at UF! (Not another dead discord!)
  * We're constantly improving, and we keep our members involved in that process.

## Our Purpose

### Community
The backbone of DevLUp is the supportive and interactive online community we foster. You can find mentors, feedback, opportunities, and friends that share the common interest in game development. We host fun social events too, including but not limited to...
* semesterly potlucks
* semesterly game nights featuring
  * rocket league
  * private MC Hunger games
  * Splitgate
  * and more... 

### Development
We want to help our members meet their goals, whether thats improving at their favorite hobby or securing a career involved in computer graphics, game development, or digital art. To that end we provide constant opportunities to build a portfolio - game jams, club-wide projects, and an emerging apply-to-enter preprofessional branch that operates at an internship level.

### Education
This is where we really shine. The website you're on will soon host a wiki of sorts allowing users to browse, aggregate, share and create educational content for eachother. Our past workshops can be found on youtube, including a beginner-sessions playlist. We also understand how critical discipline and habit are to one's education - we motivate our members to post daily updates on their personal projects directly from our discord, receiving feedback and points to stand out through our bot.
